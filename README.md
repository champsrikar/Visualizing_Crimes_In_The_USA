**Objective**: Our goal is to visualize the US Crime dataset about all crimes that happened in the USA to gain some insight on what types of crimes are committed and a general description about it. Using this visualization, we will be able to get information about safest cities in the US and various other analyses that will assist us in preventing violent crimes.

We have built a dashboard that visualizes the crime data in The USA using various bar charts, pie charts, line graph, maps.


**Uses of this Visualization:**

This visualization is extensively helpful for the Security Forces/ Police Department to identify the areas of high crime rate, time at which most percentage of crimes occur and take necessary actions like extensive patrolling and implementing security checks.

It is also useful for citizens as they can get visualization about type of crimes that most frequently occur and areas with high crime rate so that they can take precautionary measures and can avoid being a victim of a crime.
